# JavaMigration

File system you will work in is src/main/com/team2367/frc2024

In /frc2024 you have a /modules folder and three java files

Robot.java is the same as Robot.cpp, that is the "main" file (It has the teleop/auto functions)
  
Constants will contain robot details/IDs

Modules will contain the code for drive systems, manipulators, etc.
